# Enhanced Ability Card: Version

**File:** `research_review/pending/codex-main\codex-cli\src\version.ts`  
**Language:** TypeScript/JavaScript  
**Analysis Level:** Enhanced with AI

## Description

This code snippet is part of a TypeScript module that retrieves the version number of a command-line interface (CLI) application from its `package.json` file. The primary purpose of this code is to ensure that the version information is always current and accurately reflects what is specified in the `package.json`, which is essential for maintaining consistency between the codebase and the published package.

The code works by importing the `package.json` file as a JSON module, utilizing the `import` statement with a specified type of "json." This approach allows the code to access the `version` property directly from the imported package object. The version is then exported as a constant named `CLI_VERSION`, which can be used throughout the application to reference the current version of the CLI.

The architectural decision to mark `package.json` as external in the build configuration ensures that the version information is read at runtime rather than being hardcoded into the source code. This design choice eliminates the need for temporary modifications to the `package.json` file when updating the version, thereby streamlining the development process and reducing the risk of discrepancies between the code and the package metadata. By keeping the versioning dynamic and linked directly to the `package.json`, the code promotes better maintainability and accuracy in version management.

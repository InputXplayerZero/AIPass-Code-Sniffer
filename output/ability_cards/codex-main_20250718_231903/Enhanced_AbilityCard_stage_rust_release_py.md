## Description

The provided Python script, `stage_rust_release.py`, is designed to facilitate the staging of a release for an npm module after a corresponding GitHub Release has been created. The script requires the user to specify a release version via a command-line argument. It retrieves the latest workflow information associated with the specified version from GitHub Actions, specifically looking for a workflow named "rust-release." This information includes the workflow's URL and the commit SHA (headSha) associated with it. The script then prompts the user to check out the corresponding Git commit and subsequently invokes a shell script (`stage_release.sh`) to handle the actual staging of the release.

The script operates by utilizing the `subprocess` module to execute command-line commands, specifically the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to fetch workflow details and a shell script for staging the release. It employs the `argparse` library to manage command-line arguments, ensuring that the required release version is provided. The JSON output from the GitHub CLI is parsed to extract necessary details, which are then used to construct the command for the staging script. Error handling is incorporated through the use of `check=True` in subprocess calls, ensuring that any failures in command execution will raise an exception.

This design choice leverages existing command-line tools and modularizes the release process, allowing for a clear separation of concerns. By using the GitHub CLI, the script can dynamically interact with GitHub workflows, making it adaptable to changes in the repository or workflows without requiring hardcoded values. The use of a separate shell script for staging further encapsulates the release logic, promoting maintainability and clarity. Overall, this approach enhances the script's usability and robustness, making it easier for developers to stage releases efficiently.

## Quality Assessment

- **Overall Score:** 7.5/10
- **Code Quality:** 8.0/10
- **Design Quality:** 7.0/10
- **Maintainability:** 8.0/10
- **Reusability:** 7.0/10

### Strengths

- The code is well-structured and follows good coding practices.
- The use of argparse for command line argument parsing is a good practice.
- The use of subprocess.run to execute shell commands is a good practice.
- The use of pathlib for handling file paths is a good practice.

### Recommendations

- Consider adding more comments throughout the code to explain what each section is doing.
- The subprocess.run commands could be abstracted into their own functions for better modularity and reusability.
- Consider adding error handling for the subprocess.run commands, especially if the commands fail to execute.
- Consider adding type hints to the function arguments for better readability and understanding of the expected input types.

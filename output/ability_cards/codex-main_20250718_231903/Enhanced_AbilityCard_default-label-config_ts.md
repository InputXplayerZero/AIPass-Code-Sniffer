# Enhanced Ability Card: Default-Label-Config

**File:** `research_review/pending/codex-main\.github\actions\codex\src\default-label-config.ts`  
**Language:** TypeScript/JavaScript  
**Analysis Level:** Enhanced with AI

## Description

The provided code defines a function `getDefaultConfig` that returns a configuration object containing default labels and their associated prompt templates for handling various GitHub actions related to issue management and code reviews. Specifically, it includes templates for three labels: "codex-investigate-issue," "codex-code-review," and "codex-attempt-fix." Each label has a corresponding prompt template that outlines the expected response format and content for users interacting with the GitHub workflow. This functionality aims to standardize responses and streamline the process of managing issues and pull requests.

The implementation works by exporting the `getDefaultConfig` function, which constructs and returns an object containing the labels and their respective prompt templates. Each prompt template is a string that provides clear instructions on how to respond to the associated label. The templates utilize placeholders, such as `{CODEX_ACTION_ISSUE_TITLE}` and `{CODEX_ACTION_ISSUE_BODY}`, which are intended to be replaced with relevant information when the templates are used in the workflow. This design allows for flexibility and consistency in how issues and pull requests are addressed, ensuring that contributors follow a structured approach.

The architectural decisions behind this design prioritize clarity and reusability. By encapsulating the label configurations and prompt templates within a single function, the code promotes maintainability and ease of updates. If changes are needed, developers can modify the templates in one central location without affecting other parts of the codebase. This approach also enhances collaboration by providing a uniform framework for responses, which can improve communication and efficiency among team members when dealing with GitHub issues and pull requests.

## Quality Assessment

- **Overall Score:** 8.5/10
- **Code Quality:** 9.0/10
- **Design Quality:** 8.0/10
- **Maintainability:** 9.0/10
- **Reusability:** 8.0/10

### Strengths
- The code is very readable and clear. The function names and variable names are self-explanatory.
- The use of template literals makes the code clean and easy to read.
- The code is modular and each label configuration is separated into its own object, which makes it easy to add or remove labels.

### Recommendations
- Consider moving the label configurations to a separate JSON or YAML file. This would allow non-developers to easily modify the prompts without touching the code.
- The placeholders like {CODEX_ACTION_ISSUE_TITLE} and {CODEX_ACTION_ISSUE_BODY} could be documented better. It's not clear what they represent and how they are replaced.

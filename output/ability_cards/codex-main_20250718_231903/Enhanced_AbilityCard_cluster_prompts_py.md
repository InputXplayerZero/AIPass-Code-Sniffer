**Language:** Python  
**Analysis Level:** Enhanced with AI

## Description

The provided code implements an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing a collection of text prompts, primarily focusing on embedding, clustering, and reporting. It reads prompts from a CSV file, generates embeddings using the OpenAI API, and clusters these embeddings using either K-Means or DBSCAN algorithms. The script then utilizes a ChatGPT model to generate descriptive names and summaries for each identified cluster. Finally, it produces a Markdown report detailing the analysis and generates diagnostic plots to visualize cluster sizes and relationships.

The code operates in several key stages. First, it parses command-line arguments to configure input files, model selections, and output paths. It then loads the prompts, generates embeddings (potentially using a cache to avoid redundant API calls), and clusters the embeddings based on the chosen method. After clustering, it labels the clusters using the ChatGPT model and creates visualizations of the results. The design employs lazy imports for heavy libraries to enhance startup performance, especially when users only request help documentation. This modular approach allows for easy adjustments to various components, such as clustering methods and output formats, making the script both opinionated and configurable.

Architecturally, the code is structured to separate concerns clearly, with distinct functions for each major task: embedding generation, clustering, labeling, reporting, and plotting. This modularity facilitates maintenance and testing, allowing developers to easily modify or extend specific functionalities without affecting the entire pipeline. The use of external libraries like OpenAI and scikit-learn is carefully managed to optimize performance and resource usage, ensuring that the script remains efficient even when handling large datasets. Overall, this design choice enhances usability and adaptability, catering to a range of analysis needs while maintaining clarity and performance.

# Enhanced Ability Card: Ability Extractor

**File:** `src/core/ability_extractor.py`  
**Full Path:** `C:\Source-Codebase\src\core\ability_extractor.py`  
**Language:** Python  
**Analysis Level:** Enhanced with AI

## Description

The provided code is a Python script designed to generate an "Ability Card" for a specified file or directory within a software project. The Ability Card serves as a documentation tool that summarizes the functionality of the code, outlines its entry points, and visualizes its dependencies. The script detects the programming language of the target file, analyzes the code structure, and gathers dependency information to populate a predefined template. The output is a Markdown file that can be used for documentation purposes, enhancing the understanding of the codebase for developers and stakeholders.

The script operates by first determining the programming language based on the file extension. It then performs a code analysis using an external module to summarize the code's structure and functionality. Following this, it collects all relevant files in the target directory (if applicable) and analyzes their dependencies. The results from these analyses are formatted into a Markdown structure, which includes sections for the ability name, project name, description, entry points, code summary, and dependency graph. Finally, the script writes the generated Ability Card to a Markdown file, providing a clear and organized output for users.

The architectural decisions behind this design prioritize modularity and clarity. By separating the code analysis and dependency visualization into distinct functions and utilizing external modules, the script remains maintainable and extensible. The use of a template for the Ability Card ensures consistency in documentation, while the error handling mechanisms provide feedback on potential issues during analysis. This approach not only facilitates easier updates and modifications but also enhances the usability of the tool for developers looking to document their code effectively.

## Functions

- **DiffOverlay**({
  diffText,
  onExit,
}: {
  diffText: string;
  onExit: () => void;
}): * Simple scrollable view for displaying a diff.
 * The component is intentionally lightweight and mirrors the UX of
 * HistoryOverlay: Up/Down or j/k to scroll, PgUp/PgDn for paging and Esc to
 * close. The caller is responsible for computing the diff text.
- **renderLine**(line: string, idx: number): Very small helper to colorize diff lines in a basic way.

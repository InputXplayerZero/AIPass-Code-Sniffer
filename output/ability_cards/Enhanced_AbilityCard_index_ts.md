## Description

This code serves as the entry point for a command-line interface (CLI) application, specifically the Gemini CLI, which is part of a larger project developed by Google LLC. The primary purpose of this script is to initialize and execute the main functionality of the application by importing the core logic from the `gemini.js` module. It ensures that any unexpected errors during execution are caught and logged, providing a clear message to the user before the process exits.

The script begins by importing the necessary module and then calls the `main` function from `gemini.js`. This function is expected to return a promise, allowing for asynchronous operations. If an error occurs during the execution of `main`, it is caught in the `catch` block, where the error is logged to the console. The code checks if the error is an instance of the `Error` class to provide a detailed stack trace; otherwise, it converts the error to a string for logging. Finally, the script exits the process with a status code of 1, indicating that an error has occurred.

The design of this code emphasizes robustness and user feedback. By using a promise-based approach, it allows for handling asynchronous tasks effectively, which is common in CLI applications that may involve I/O operations. The error handling mechanism is crucial for maintaining a good user experience, as it provides clear insights into what went wrong, rather than failing silently. This architectural decision reflects a focus on reliability and maintainability, ensuring that developers can easily diagnose issues when they arise.

# Enhanced Ability Card: Skill Analyzer

**File:** `src/core/skill_analyzer.py`  
**Full Path:** `C:\Source-Codebase\src\core\skill_analyzer.py`  
**Language:** Python  
**Analysis Level:** Enhanced with AI

## Description

The code defines a skill analysis and reporting engine that generates detailed reports on skills detected within a specified codebase, particularly for integration with the AIPass-Ecosystem. It analyzes various file types (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript) to identify skills using an `AdvancedSkillDetector`. The output includes a structured report detailing the number of files analyzed, skills detected, and organized skill categories, along with recommendations for skill extraction and integration.

The `SkillAnalyzer` class orchestrates the analysis process by walking through the codebase directory, filtering out common ignore directories, and processing files with supported extensions. It detects skills in each file and aggregates them into modules if multiple skills are found. The analysis results are compiled into a `SkillAnalysisReport`, which includes a timestamp, file paths, and a breakdown of skills by category. The report can be saved in both JSON and Markdown formats for easy access and readability.

This design emphasizes modularity and clarity, allowing for easy extension and maintenance. By separating the analysis, report generation, and saving functionalities into distinct methods, the code promotes single responsibility and enhances readability. The use of data classes for structured reporting simplifies data handling, while the decision to avoid artificial priorities in skill categorization ensures that the reports reflect an accurate representation of the detected skills. This architecture supports scalability and adaptability for future enhancements in skill detection and reporting capabilities.

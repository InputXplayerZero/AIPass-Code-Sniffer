# Enhanced Ability Card: Project Mapper

**File:** `src/utils/project_mapper.py`  
**Language:** Python  
**Analysis Level:** Enhanced with AI

## Description

The provided code is a Python script designed to generate a textual representation of a directory structure up to a specified depth. It utilizes the `os` module to traverse the file system and the `argparse` module to handle command-line arguments. The main functionality is encapsulated in the `map_directory` function, which constructs a string that visually represents the directory and its files, formatted with indentation to indicate depth. The script saves this representation to a file named "project_map.txt" and provides feedback to the user regarding the success of the operation.

The code operates by walking through the directory tree starting from a specified root directory using `os.walk()`. It calculates the current depth of traversal by counting the number of directory separators in the path. If the current depth exceeds the user-defined maximum depth, it prevents further descent into subdirectories by modifying the `dirs` list. The directory names and file names are formatted with appropriate indentation to reflect their hierarchy, creating a clear visual structure in the output.

This design choice of using a depth-limited traversal allows users to focus on a manageable portion of the directory structure, which is particularly useful for large projects. The use of command-line arguments enhances usability, enabling users to specify the root directory and depth dynamically. Additionally, error handling is implemented to ensure that the provided directory exists before attempting to map it, making the script robust and user-friendly. Overall, the architecture emphasizes clarity and simplicity, allowing developers to quickly understand and utilize the functionality without unnecessary complexity.

- **Overall Score:** 8.5/10
- **Code Quality:** 8.5/10
- **Design Quality:** 8.0/10
- **Maintainability:** 8.5/10
- **Reusability:** 8.0/10

### Strengths

- The code is well-structured and easy to read.
- Good use of docstrings and comments to explain what the code is doing.
- The use of argparse for command line argument parsing is a good practice.
- The code checks if the directory exists before trying to map it, which is a good practice.

### Recommendations

- Consider using a more efficient string concatenation method for large directories. Using '+=' in a loop can be slow because strings are immutable in Python, so each '+=' creates a new string. You could use a list to store the lines and then join them at the end.
- The 'map_directory' function could be split into smaller functions to improve modularity and reusability. For example, a separate function could be created to handle the generation of the indentation.
- Consider adding error handling for potential issues, such as permission errors when trying to access certain directories or files.


## Functions

- **map_directory**(root_dir, max_depth): Generates a string representation of the directory structure.

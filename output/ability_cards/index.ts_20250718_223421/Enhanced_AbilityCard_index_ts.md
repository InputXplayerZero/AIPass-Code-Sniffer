## Description

This code serves as the entry point for a Node.js application designed to manage a server, specifically for a project called "DesktopCommander." Its primary functionality includes setting up the server, handling configuration loading, and managing command execution through a command manager. The application also incorporates error handling mechanisms for uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections, ensuring that issues such as JSON parsing errors are logged without crashing the server. The code can be run with an optional "setup" argument to execute a setup script before starting the server.

The implementation begins by importing necessary modules and defining a helper function to create file URLs, particularly accommodating Windows file path formats. The `runServer` function orchestrates the application flow, checking for setup commands, managing server connections, and loading configurations. It employs robust error handling to capture and log errors, including fatal errors that prevent the server from starting. The use of the `capture` utility suggests that error tracking is integrated, allowing for better monitoring of issues in production environments.

Architecturally, this design emphasizes resilience and maintainability. By separating concerns—such as configuration management, command handling, and error logging—the code is structured to facilitate easier debugging and future enhancements. The decision to handle different operating systems' path formats demonstrates a commitment to cross-platform compatibility. Overall, the code is structured to ensure that the server can start reliably, recover gracefully from errors, and provide meaningful feedback to developers and users alike.

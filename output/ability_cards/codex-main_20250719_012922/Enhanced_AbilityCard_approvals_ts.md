## Functions

- **canAutoApprove**(command: ReadonlyArray<string>, workdir: string | undefined, policy: ApprovalPolicy, writableRoots: ReadonlyArray<string>, env: NodeJS.ProcessEnv = process.env): * Tries to assess whether a command is safe to run, though may defer to the
 * user for approval.
 *
 * Note `env` must be the same `env` that will be used to spawn the process.
- **canAutoApproveApplyPatch**(applyPatchArg: string, workdir: string | undefined, writableRoots: ReadonlyArray<string>, policy: ApprovalPolicy): None
- **isWritePatchConstrainedToWritablePaths**(applyPatchArg: string, workdir: string | undefined, writableRoots: ReadonlyArray<string>): * All items in `writablePaths` must be absolute paths.
- **allPathsConstrainedTowritablePaths**(candidatePaths: ReadonlyArray<string>, workdir: string | undefined, writableRoots: ReadonlyArray<string>): None
- **isPathConstrainedTowritablePaths**(candidatePath: string, workdir: string | undefined, writableRoots: ReadonlyArray<string>): If candidatePath is relative, it will be resolved against cwd.
- **resolvePathAgainstWorkdir**(candidatePath: string, workdir: string | undefined): * If not already an absolute path, resolves `candidatePath` against `workdir`
 * if specified; otherwise, against `process.cwd()`.
- **pathContains**(parent: string, child: string): Both `parent` and `child` must be absolute paths.
- **tryParseApplyPatch**(bashArg: string): * `bashArg` might be something like "apply_patch << 'EOF' *** Begin...".
 * If this function returns a string, then it is the content the arg to
 * apply_patch with the heredoc removed.
- **isSafeCommand**(command: ReadonlyArray<string>): * If this is a "known safe" command, returns the (reason, group); otherwise,
 * returns null.
- **isValidSedNArg**(arg: string | undefined): None
- **isEntireShellExpressionSafe**(parts: ReadonlyArray<ParseEntry>): * Determines whether a parsed shell expression consists solely of safe
 * commands (as per `isSafeCommand`) combined using only operators in
 * `SAFE_SHELL_OPERATORS`.
 *
 * If entirely safe, returns the reason/group from the *first* command
 * segment so callers can surface a meaningful description. Otherwise returns
 * null.
- **isParseEntryWithOp**(entry: ParseEntry): Runtime type guard that narrows a `ParseEntry` to the variants that
carry an `op` field. Using a dedicated function avoids the need for
inline type assertions and makes the narrowing reusable and explicit.

# Enhanced Ability Card: Skill Analyzer

**File:** [`skill_analyzer.py`](file:///C:\Source-Codebase\src\core\skill_analyzer.py)  
**Full Path:** `C:\Source-Codebase\src\core\skill_analyzer.py`  
**Language:** Python  
**Analysis Level:** Enhanced with AI

## Description

The code in `src/core/skill_analyzer.py` implements a skill analysis and reporting engine designed to generate detailed reports on skills detected within a codebase, specifically for integration with the AIPass-Ecosystem. It analyzes files in a specified directory, focusing on common programming file types (like Python and JavaScript), to identify and categorize skills using an `AdvancedSkillDetector`. The output includes a comprehensive report detailing the number of files analyzed, skills detected, and recommendations for skill extraction and integration.

The main functionality is encapsulated in the `SkillAnalyzer` class, which traverses the codebase directory, reads files, and applies the skill detection logic. It maintains a count of analyzed files and detected skills, organizes skills by category, and generates a structured report. The report is saved in both JSON and Markdown formats, providing a user-friendly overview of the findings. The design employs data classes for structured data representation and uses methods to separate concerns, such as report generation and file saving, enhancing maintainability and clarity.

This architecture promotes modularity and ease of extension. By separating the analysis logic from the report generation and file handling, the code allows for future enhancements, such as integrating additional skill detection methods or modifying report formats without disrupting the core functionality. The use of data classes simplifies data management, while the structured approach to file analysis ensures that the tool can efficiently handle various codebases while providing meaningful insights into the skills present within them.

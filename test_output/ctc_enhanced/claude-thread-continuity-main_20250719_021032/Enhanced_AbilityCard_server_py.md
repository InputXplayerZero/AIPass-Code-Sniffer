## Description

This code implements a server for the Claude Thread Continuity system, which aims to maintain conversation context across different threads by automatically saving and restoring project states. Key functionalities include state persistence, context restoration, local JSON storage for privacy, and synchronization with a Memory MCP (Memory Management Control Protocol) for data consistency. The server supports multiple projects, provides project validation to avoid fragmentation, and features smart auto-save triggers based on user interactions.

The server is structured around a `ContinuityServer` class that initializes project state management and handles various tool requests, such as saving and loading project states, listing active projects, and validating project names. It utilizes asynchronous programming with `asyncio` to handle requests efficiently. The `ProjectState` class manages the local storage of project states, while the `MemoryMCPSync` class handles interactions with the Memory MCP for syncing project data. The server also implements logging for monitoring and debugging purposes, ensuring that any issues can be traced effectively.

The architectural decisions reflect a focus on modularity and separation of concerns, allowing for easier maintenance and extensibility. By using JSON for local storage, the system ensures privacy and simplicity in data management. The asynchronous approach enhances responsiveness, enabling the server to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking. Overall, this design facilitates seamless conversation continuity, making it suitable for applications that require persistent context across user interactions.

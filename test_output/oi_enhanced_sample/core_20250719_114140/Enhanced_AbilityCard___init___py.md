## Description

The provided code snippet from the file `__init__.py` in the `contacts` directory of the `open-interpreter-main` project is empty. This indicates that the file may serve as an initializer for the `contacts` module, allowing it to define a package structure without any specific functionality implemented within it. In Python, an `__init__.py` file is used to mark a directory as a package, enabling the import of modules contained within that directory.

Since the file does not contain any code, there are no key mechanisms or approaches to discuss. However, the design choice to include an empty `__init__.py` file suggests that the developers may plan to implement functionality related to contact management in the future or want to maintain the module's structure for organizational purposes. This architectural decision allows for easy expansion and modularity, as additional components can be added to the `contacts` package without disrupting the existing codebase.

In summary, while the current state of the `__init__.py` file does not provide any functionality, it plays a crucial role in defining the `contacts` module as part of the larger project. This design choice supports future development and maintains a clean package structure.

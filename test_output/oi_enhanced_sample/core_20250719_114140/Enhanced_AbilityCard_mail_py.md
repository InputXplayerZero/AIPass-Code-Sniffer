## Description

The provided code defines a `Mail` class that facilitates email operations on macOS using AppleScript. It includes methods to retrieve the last few emails from the inbox, send emails with optional attachments, and count unread emails. The class is designed to interact specifically with the macOS Mail application, leveraging AppleScript to perform actions such as fetching messages and sending emails. It includes functionality to limit the number of emails retrieved, handle retries if there are not enough emails available, and estimate upload times for attachments.

The core functionality is implemented through AppleScript commands embedded within Python strings, which are executed using the `run_applescript` and `run_applescript_capture` utility functions. The `get` method retrieves emails based on specified criteria (number and read status), while the `send` method constructs an email message, optionally attaching files and managing delays based on attachment sizes. The `unread_count` method provides a count of unread emails, capped at 50. The class also includes helper methods for formatting file paths for AppleScript and calculating estimated upload delays based on file sizes.

This design choice to use AppleScript is primarily due to the need for seamless integration with the macOS Mail application, which is not directly accessible through standard Python libraries. The architectural decisions, such as limiting the number of emails and retrying on insufficient results, enhance user experience by providing robust error handling and ensuring that the application remains responsive. Additionally, the code is structured to allow future enhancements, such as supporting different email applications or customizing the sender's address, reflecting a forward-thinking approach to software design.

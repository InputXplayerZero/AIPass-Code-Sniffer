# Tool Ideas for AIPass-Code-Sniffer Development

**Objective:** To document potential automated tools identified during manual codebase analysis that would enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of functional indexing and codebase understanding for the AIPass-Echosystem. These tools will form the core of the "AIPass-Code-Sniffer."

## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Tools

### 1. Enhanced Code Search & Navigation

*   **Purpose:** To enable semantic and relational searches within codebases, going beyond simple text patterns to understand code structure and dependencies.
*   **Problem Addressed:** Current `search_file_content` and `glob` are powerful but lack code-specific intelligence, making it hard to find functions by their role or callers.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   Search for functions/classes by their purpose (e.g., "functions that read files").
    *   Find all callers/implementations of a specific function/method.
    *   Identify code related to a specific concept (e.g., "authentication logic").
    *   Navigate code relationships (e.g., "show me where this variable is defined and used").
*   **Technical Considerations:** Requires parsing code into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) or leveraging Language Server Protocol (LSP) capabilities.

### 2. Automated Function/Class Dissection & Summarization (`code_summarizer.py`)

*   **Purpose:** To automatically extract key information and generate concise summaries for functions, classes, or code blocks.
*   **Problem Addressed:** Manually populating "Component" sections in "Ability Cards" (inputs, outputs, dependencies, description) is time-consuming.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   Given a code snippet or function/class path, identify its parameters, return types, and external dependencies.
    *   Generate a natural language summary of its purpose based on code logic, comments, and docstrings.
    *   Extract relevant code examples.
*   **Technical Considerations:** Could involve static code analysis, LLM-based summarization, and pattern matching for common code structures.

### 3. Automated Dependency Graphing (`dependency_visualizer.py`)

*   **Purpose:** To visualize the internal dependencies between modules, files, and functions within a project.
*   **Problem Addressed:** Manually tracing execution flow and understanding internal dependencies is complex and error-prone, especially in large codebases.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   Parse import/require statements and function/method calls.
    *   Generate graphical representations (e.g., using Graphviz) of module-level or function-level dependencies.
    *   Highlight critical paths or highly coupled components.
*   **Technical Considerations:** Requires robust parsing for various languages and integration with graphing libraries.

### 4. "Ability Card" Draft Generator (`ability_extractor.py`)

*   **Purpose:** To automate the initial drafting of "Ability Cards" for identified functional modules.
*   **Problem Addressed:** The manual creation of "Ability Cards" from a template is repetitive.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   Combine outputs from Enhanced Code Search, Code Summarizer, and Dependency Visualizer.
    *   Automatically populate sections of the "Ability Card" template (Entry Points, Components, Best Practices, Potential for AIPass-Echosystem).
    *   Suggest relevant related files and resources.
*   **Technical Considerations:** This tool would act as an orchestrator, leveraging the capabilities of other automated tools. It would require heuristics to identify "abilities" and their boundaries.

### 5. Automated Index Updater

*   **Purpose:** To automatically maintain and update the `ABILITIES_INDEX.md` file.
*   **Problem Addressed:** Manually adding new entries to the central index and ensuring correct formatting and links is prone to errors and tedious.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   Scan `analysis/<project>/abilities/` directories for new or updated "Ability Cards."
    *   Extract metadata (Ability Name, Project, Category, Description, File Path) from the Markdown files.
    *   Automatically add/update entries in `ABILITIES_INDEX.md`, maintaining categorization and links.
*   **Technical Considerations:** Simple file system scanning and Markdown parsing.

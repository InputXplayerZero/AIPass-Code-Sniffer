### **Project: Open-Source Codebase Analysis**

**Objective:** Systematically analyze open-source projects to understand their architecture, identify reusable modules, and inform the development of a new, advanced ecosystem.

### **Phase 1: Project Reconnaissance & Triage**

The goal of this phase is to get a high-level overview of every project in the `C:\Source-Codebase` directory.

**Actions:**
1.  **Initial Scaffolding:** Create a central `analysis` directory to store our findings.
2.  **Automated Project Summaries:** For each sub-project (e.g., `gemini-cli-main`, `codex-main`):
    *   Run the `project_mapper.py` script to generate a directory map.
    *   Extract the project's purpose from its `README.md`.
    *   Identify the primary technologies and dependencies (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.).
3.  **Create a Master Index:** Generate a single `INDEX.md` file in the `analysis` directory that provides a one-line summary and a link to the detailed analysis for each project.

### **Phase 2: Deep-Dive Analysis**

In this phase, we'll select promising projects from Phase 1 and analyze their code in detail.

**Actions:**
1.  **Targeted Code Search:** Based on your interests (e.g., "authentication," "plugin architecture," "UI rendering"), I will perform targeted searches across the codebase to find relevant files.
2.  **Code & Logic Summarization:** I will read the content of key files and provide plain-English summaries of their functionality, inputs, and outputs.
3.  **Pattern Identification:** We will look for common design patterns, architectural choices, and how different parts of the application communicate.

### **Phase 3: Module Extraction & Documentation**

The goal here is to document promising modules in a structured way for future use.

**Actions:**
1.  **Create a Module Template:** We'll define a standard template (a Markdown file) for documenting each reusable module we find. It will include sections for:
    *   Module Name & Source Path
    *   Purpose & Functionality
    *   Key Dependencies
    *   API/Usage Example
    *   Notes on Reusability
2.  **Populate Module Documents:** As we identify valuable modules in Phase 2, we'll create a new document from the template and fill it out.

### **Our Custom Toolkit**

To accelerate our research, we will build a suite of custom scripts.

**Tools to Build:**
1.  **`project_mapper.py` (Done):** Generates a file/directory map with depth control.
2.  **`tech_stack_detector.py`:** A script that scans a project, identifies files like `package.json` or `requirements.txt`, and outputs a summary of the languages, frameworks, and key libraries.
3.  **`dependency_visualizer.py` (Advanced):** A script that could parse code to trace `import`/`require` statements and generate a dependency graph (e.g., using Graphviz) to visualize how modules interact.

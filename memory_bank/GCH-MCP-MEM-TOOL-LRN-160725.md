# Chat Log: Attempts to use MCP memory tools and clarification of agent capabilities

## Summary
This session involved attempts to automate the population of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) knowledge graph by the Gemini agent. Initial attempts were based on a misunderstanding of the agent's direct tool access to MCP functions like `create_entity` and `add_observations`. It was clarified that the agent's `save_memory` tool is for internal, user-specific memory, not the external MCP knowledge graph.

## Key Accomplishments
*   Identified that the Gemini agent does not have direct, callable tools for `create_entity` or `add_observations` to interact with the external MCP knowledge graph.
*   Clarified the distinction between the agent's internal memory (accessed via `save_memory`) and the external MCP knowledge graph.
*   Understood that direct MCP interaction for the agent would require a custom tool that wraps MCP functionalities.

## Outcome
A clearer understanding of the Gemini agent's current tool limitations regarding direct interaction with the MCP knowledge graph. The previous "demonstration" of storing abilities was flawed as it used the agent's internal memory. Future steps for populating the MCP knowledge graph will require either providing the agent with a custom MCP interaction tool or using direct CLI commands for manual verification.
